FatRat uses the CMake build system, just like KDE 4.

An example compilation procedure:

cmake . -DWITH_BITTORRENT=ON -DWITH_SFTP=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
make install

The prefix can be changed to /usr using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr. The default prefix is /usr/local,
but may be implementation dependent.

Should you need to make install to a different directory, the traditional DESTDIR is supported.

CMake may have issues finding your JDK installation. Should that happen, try exporting variables such as
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2, JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH and JAVA_JVM_LIB_PATH.

All shared data is stored in prefix/share/fatrat:

* lang/ - Localization files
* doc/ - Optional end-user documentaton
* data/ - Other data
  * remote/ - Data for the web interface
  * java/ - Data for Java extensions
  * btsearch/ - Parse information for the Torrent Search
  * btlinks.txt - Regular expressions that help identify .torrent links
  * mirrors.txt - Mirror lists for segmented downloads mirror search
  * defaults.conf - Default confguration options
  * genssl.cnf - OpenSSL configuration file for one-click certificate generation

User data is stored in ~/.local/share/fatrat, except for the configuration file located in
~/.config/Dolezel/fatrat.conf

* data/ - All files stored in this directory have precedence over files stored in prefix/share/fatrat/data
          Notably all installed Java extensions are stored here.
* torrents/ - .torrent file storage, needs to be purged time from time
* queues.xml - Information about all queues and transfers in FatRat

FatRat installs a single binary in prefix/bin/fatrat and creates a symlink named "fatrat-nogui", which is
really just an alias for 'fatrat --nogui'.
