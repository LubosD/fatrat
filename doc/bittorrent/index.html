<p>
FatRat includes an extensive BitTorrent support. However, its usage may not be as intuitive as with other BitTorrent clients, since FatRat is a universal download manager.

The first important thing to know is that torrents aren't marked as completed, until the share ratio has been reached. This means that an active BitTorrent transfer has two states: downloading and seeding. You can tell these two from each other by looking at the completion bar or the state icon (blue icon = downloading, red icon = uploading). The default share ratio can be set in the settings dialog. Alternatively, the maximum share ratio can be changed on a per torrent basis - see the transfer properties.

If you want to seed infinitely, force resume the transfer. The transfer won't be stopped as "completed" then.
