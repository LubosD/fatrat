In this window you can find all settings related to the Jabber remote control. Server hostname and port are automatically retrieved from DNS SRV records - therefore, no extra fields for this information are present.

<p>
If you set the priority to a negative value, no messages should reach FatRat if somebody just doubleclicks our contact in his contact list. With a negative priority only messages directly sent to our resource name are delivered instead of getting stored at the Jabber server. You should set a negative priority if you're sharing your personal Jabber account with FatRat. However, in case you've created a special Jabber account for FatRat, it is handy to use a positive priority. All Jabber error or information messages are written into the global log. Refer to the log in case of any trouble.

<p>
<b>Grant roster authorizations upon request</b> will cause FatRat to respond to any roster requests positively. If disabled, FatRat will ignore any such requests.
</p>

<p>
<b>Restrict access to my own JID</b> should be used only if you haven't allocated a special account for FatRat. In this mode, FatRat will accept only messages coming from the same JID specified in the settings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Restrict access using a password</b> - FatRat won't let anybody to take control over the application unless the correct password is specified beforehand. After a certain period of inactivity, the remote user will have to re-authenticate.
